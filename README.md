# Jekyll Composer

## How to use

1. Copy folder `jekyll-composer` to your jekyll blog folder
2. On CommandLine or Bash:
	
	```bash
	> node jekyll-composer.js
	```

3. Go to browser and open `http://localhost:8080/`

## Requirement

* Node.js

## Why?

I'm too lazy to make a Markdown file in _drafts, write boring markdown in editor and move it to _posts for publish.

Now, I can make a post in browser and with a clear UI than editor.

## How it work?

Just read and write file on folder `_drafts`, `_posts` and `images`
